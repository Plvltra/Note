- ![How to Lose Time and Money](https://paulgraham.com/selfindulgence.html)
	- In fact the way most fortunes are lost is not through excessive expenditure, but through bad investments. 
	- In most people's minds, spending money on luxuries sets off alarms that making investments doesn't. Luxuries seem self-indulgent. And unless you got the money by inheriting it or winning a lottery, you've already been thoroughly trained that self-indulgence leads to trouble. Investing bypasses those alarms. You're not spending the money; you're just moving it from one asset to another.
	- A few days ago I realized something surprising: the situation with time is much the same as with money. **The most dangerous way to lose time is not to spend it having fun, but to spend it doing fake work**.
		- Because I'm doing stuff that seems, superficially, like real work. Dealing with email, for example. You do it sitting at a desk. It's not fun. So it must be work.
- **If you think something's supposed to hurt, you're less likely to notice if you're doing it wrong.** That about sums up my experience of graduate school.
- ![How to Do What You Love](https://paulgraham.com/love.html)
	- The fact is, almost anyone would rather, at any given moment, float about in the Carribbean, or have sex, or eat some delicious food, than work on hard problems. The rule about doing what you love assumes a certain length of time. It doesn't mean, do what will make you happiest this second, but what will make you happiest over some longer period, like a week or a month.
	- Another test you can use is: always produce. For example, if you have a day job you don't take seriously because you plan to be a novelist, are you producing? Are you writing pages of fiction, however bad? As long as you're producing, **you'll know you're not merely using the hazy vision of the grand novel you plan to write one day as an opiate**. The view of it will be obstructed by the all too palpably flawed one you're actually writing.
- ![How to Do Great Work](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html)
	- There are a lot of forces that will lead you astray when you're trying to figure out what to work on. Pretentiousness, fashion, fear, money, politics, other people's wishes, eminent frauds. But if you stick to what you find genuinely interesting, you'll be proof against all of them. If you're interested, you're not astray.
	- It will probably be harder to start working than to keep working. You'll often have to trick yourself to get over that initial threshold. Don't worry about this; it's the nature of work, not a flaw in your character. Work has a sort of activation energy, both per day and per project. And since this threshold is fake in the sense that it's higher than the energy required to keep going, it's ok to tell yourself a lie of corresponding magnitude to get over it.  
 	<br>

	- When I'm reluctant to start work in the morning, **I often trick myself by saying "I'll just read over what I've got so far."** Five minutes later I've found something that seems mistaken or incomplete, and I'm off.
	- Similar techniques work for starting new projects. **It's ok to lie to yourself about how much work a project will entail**, for example. Lots of great things began with someone saying "**How hard could it be?**"
	- Try to finish what you start, though, even if it turns out to be more work than you expected. Finishing things is not just an exercise in tidiness or self-discipline. **In many projects a lot of the best work happens in what was meant to be the final stage**.  
	- Another permissible lie is **to exaggerate the importance of what you're working on**, at least in your own mind. If that helps you discover something new, it may turn out not to have been a lie after all.
	<br>
	
	- Since there are two senses of starting work — per day and per project — there are also two forms of procrastination. **Per-project procrastination is far the more dangerous.** You put off starting that ambitious project from year to year because the time isn't quite right. When you're procrastinating in units of years, you can get a lot not done. 
	- One reason per-project procrastination is so dangerous is that it usually camouflages itself as work. You're not just sitting around doing nothing; you're working industriously on something else. So per-project procrastination doesn't set off the alarms that per-day procrastination does. You're too busy to notice it.  
	- The way to beat it is to stop occasionally and ask yourself: **Am I working on what I most want to work on?** When you're young it's ok if the answer is sometimes no, but this gets increasingly dangerous as you get older.
 	<br>

	- If you do work that compounds, you'll get exponential growth. Most people who do this do it unconsciously, but it's worth stopping to think about. Learning, for example, is an instance of this phenomenon: **the more you learn about something, the easier it is to learn more**. Growing an audience is another: the more fans you have, the more new fans they'll bring you.  
	- The trouble with **exponential growth is that the curve feels flat in the beginning**. It isn't; it's still a wonderful exponential curve. But we can't grasp that intuitively, so we underrate exponential growth in its early stages.

	- **If you don't try to be the best, you won't even be good.**
	- There may be some jobs where it's an advantage to be cynical and pessimistic, but **if you want to do great work it's an advantage to be optimistic**, even though that means you'll risk looking like a fool sometimes. There's an old tradition of doing the opposite. The Old Testament says it's better to keep quiet lest you look like a fool. But that's advice for _seeming_ smart. If you actually want to discover new things, it's better to take the risk of telling people your ideas.
 	<br>

	- For example, **schools induce passivity**. Since you were a small child, there was an authority at the front of the class telling all of you what you had to learn and then measuring whether you did. But neither classes nor tests are intrinsic to learning; they're just artifacts of the way schools are usually designed. The sooner you overcome this passivity, the better.
	- Schools also give you a misleading impression of what work is like. In school they tell you what the problems are, and they're almost always soluble using no more than you've been taught so far. **In real life you have to figure out what the problems are, and you often don't know if they're soluble at all**.
	- **Don't think of yourself as dependent on some gatekeeper giving you a "big break."** Even if this were true, the best way to get it would be to focus on doing good work rather than chasing influential people.
 	<br>

	- Seek out the best colleagues. There are a lot of projects that can't be done alone, and even if you're working on one that can be, it's good to have other people to encourage you and to bounce ideas off.  **Colleagues don't just affect your work, though; they also affect you.** So work with people you want to become like, because you will.
	- How do you know when you have sufficiently good colleagues? In my experience, when you do, you know. Which means if you're unsure, you probably don't. Sufficiently good colleagues offer _surprising_ insights.
 	<br>
 
	- Husband your morale. It's the basis of everything when you're working on ambitious projects. You have to nurture and protect it like a living organism.
	-   Morale starts with your view of life. You're more likely to do great work if you're an optimist, and more likely to if you think of yourself as lucky than if you think of yourself as a victim.
	- **One of the biggest mistakes ambitious people make is to allow setbacks to destroy their morale all at once**, like a balloon bursting. You can inoculate yourself against this by explicitly considering setbacks a part of your process. Solving hard problems always involves some backtracking.  
	- Doing great work is a depth-first search whose root node is the desire to. So "If at first you don't succeed, try, try again" isn't quite right. It should be: **If at first you don't succeed, either try again, or backtrack and then try again**.  
	- "Never give up" is also not quite right. **Obviously there are times when it's the right choice to eject.** A more precise version would be: Never let setbacks panic you into backtracking more than you need to. 
	- Ultimately morale is physical. You think with your body, so it's important to take care of it. That means exercising regularly, eating and sleeping well, and avoiding the more dangerous kinds of drugs. Running and walking are particularly good forms of exercise because they're good for thinking.
	-  In fact, **if you're smart and ambitious, it's dangerous _not_ to be productive. People who are smart and ambitious but don't achieve much tend to become bitter**.
 	<br>
 	
	- Competition can be an effective motivator, but don't let it choose the problem for you; **don't let yourself get drawn into chasing something just because others are**. In fact, don't let competitors make you do anything much more specific than work harder. 
	- **Curiosity is the key** to all four steps in doing great work: it will choose the field for you, get you to the frontier, cause you to notice the gaps in it, and drive you to explore them.
